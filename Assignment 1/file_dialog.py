    # In addition to demonstrating the opening of a file dialogue, this test
    # code reads and processes a comma-separated values (csv) text file of
    # numbers, a file structured somewhat like this:
    #
    #   3.2,-7,33,92
    #   1,2.0,15,153.2
    #   ...
    #
    # I've over-commented since the code is likely to be hard to understand.

    # This next statement causes an open file dialogue to appear, and loads
    # csv_file_path with the name of the file (if any) selected by the user.

        ('comma-separated values', 'csv'),))

    # guards against that possibility.

        # If execution got here, the user chose a csv file to open.

        # be opened for reading as simple text files.

        # potentially very long string, and strips any blank lines at the ends.

        lines = file_data.split('\n') # \n is the new-line character.
        # Then, I'll split each line at the commas
        for i in range(len(lines)):
